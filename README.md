The U4-0203 (Ultimanium 4) is an experimental computer finalized in October 2025. The ISA, officially named UA-4, consists of 32 opcodes and 26 unique mnemonics, making it reduced yet turing-complete. For most instructions, the first nybble is the opcode and the second holds the operand(s).
There are 20 registers in total, labeled r0-r3 and a0-a15. r0 is a zero register; all writes to it are ignored, and all reads from it return 0x0. r1-r3 are general-purpose operating registers; you can perform arithmetic and logical operations on them. a0-a15 are data registers; you can only read from and write to them.
The ALU is capable of addition and subtraction, as well as AND, OR, XOR, and their inverse counterparts. There is one flag, the carry flag, which is set when the last comparison was equal or when the last addition overflowed. There are exceptions such as INCC (increment with carry), which is a version of INC that modifies the carry flag.
